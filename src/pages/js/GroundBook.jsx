                The Problem: Students, faculty, and community members face
                challenges in booking the GCIT ground due to unclear procedures,
                limited information about availability, and lack of a
                centralized booking platform.

              <h3>User Research</h3>
              <p>
                Conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the
                needs of our target audience. Key user groups included students,
                event organizers, and faculty members. Research showed that
                users wanted easy access to information on ground availability,
                flexible scheduling options, and straightforward communication
                with the ground management team.

                  What I Learned: Early design ideas are a foundation, but user
