              <p>
                I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand
                the target audience. Key user groups identified include young
                professionals and families looking for rental properties. The
                research confirmed that convenience, transparency, and
                accessibility are vital for renters. Users expressed a need for
                detailed property information, flexible viewing options, and
                straightforward communication with landlords.
